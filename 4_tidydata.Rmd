WHO: A subset of data from the World Health Organization Global Tuberculosis Report. It is a data frame with 7,240 rows and the columns: 1) `country`: Country name 2)`iso2`, `iso3`: 2 & 3 letter ISO country codes 3) `year`:Year

---
```{r}
head(who[,5:12])
```

 4) `new_sp_m014` - `new_rel_f65`: Counts of new TB cases recorded by group. Column names encode three variables that describe the group:    
 
  * The first three letters of each column denote whether the column contains `new` or `old` cases of TB. In this dataset, each column contains new cases.
  * The next two letters describe the type of TB:
     * `rel` stands for cases of relapse
     * `ep` stands for cases of extrapulmonary TB
     * `sn` stands for cases of pulmonary TB that could not be diagnosed by a pulmonary smear (smear negative)
     * `sp` stands for cases of pulmonary TB that could be diagnosed by a pulmonary smear (smear positive)
     * The sixth letter gives the sex of TB patients. The dataset groups cases by males (`m`) and females (`f`).
